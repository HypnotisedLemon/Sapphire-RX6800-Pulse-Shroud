1. A shroud for making deshrouding look more elegant (hopefully). <br />
2. This shround is ONLY compatible with Sapphire RX6800 Pulse. <br />
3. It includes shrouds for 120mm and 92mm fans, for both standard and slim thickness. <br />
4. An additional minimal shroud design for those who just want something for their fans to attach to and dont care about covering the bare heatsink. <br />
5. Uses standard fan screws to make fan installation as simple as possible with countersunk on holes to keep thew screws flush with the shroud.
